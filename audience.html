                                <h3>ðŸ”˜ <b>Insights & Analytics Associate Editor at Insider</b></h3>

                                I'm currently on the Insights & Analytics Team at Insider, where I focus on gauging impact and informing digital
                                strategy using performance data. Basically, I spend my time looking at metrics including pageviews, source referrals, 
                                and engaged time to assess a) what content resonated with our audiences, b) where it was resonating, and c) why 
                                it was resonating. (I will not say resonating again, I promise.) I then provide teams with insights based on that data so they can make decisions that take into account what our 
                                audience cares about!
                                <br><br>
                                Some of the things I do day-to-day include: 
                                <br>
                                <ul>
                                <li>building tools and dashboards that make performance metrics accessible to editors and reporters</li>
                                <li>crafting data-based coverage plans for events like the Meta Gala and the Masters</li>
                                <li>maintaining daily and monthly traffic and source reports</li>
                                <li>tracking and assessing our performance on different social platforms</li>
                                </ul>
                                A lot of the stuff I do nowadays is âœ¨ proprietary âœ¨ so I can't link you to it, but feel 
                                free to <a href="mailto:daisymmgrant@gmail.com">contact me</a> if you have questions about what I do right now!

                                <h3>ðŸ”˜ <b>Web Distribution Fellow at Insider</b></h3>

                                In the first half of 2022, I was a social media fellow on Insider's distribution team, where I packaged and distributed 
                                stories across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. I managed these social channels and ensured that breaking 
                                and timely news got onto the proper accounts. I wrote Twitter threads and created social graphics. 
                                I also packaged stories for Insider's Digg space and our two Telegram channels.

                                In the summer of 2021 I was a digital team intern at The Virginian-Pilot and The Daily Press, 
                                where I distributed stories across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. I also helped run the two websites,
                                which involved managing the home pages, writing headlines, and organizing their publication schedules. 
                                <br><br>
                                I also revamped the papers' daily newsletters, using past analytics and market research to redesign the format and strategy.
                                I then wrote original daily copy for both newsletters to add voice, context and depth to the top stories. 
                                <br><br>

                                <h3><b>ðŸ”˜ Editor in Chief and Digital Strategy Director at The Diamondback</b></h3>
                                I worked at the University of Maryland's student newspaper for 3.5 years while I was at school across 
                                a variety of different roles, including copy editor, managing editor, arts and culture editor, engagement
                                editor, director of digital strategy, and, finally, editor in chief. Some highlights of my time at the DBK include
                                coordinating and executing social media coverage of the 2020 presidential election, creating a 
                                community-focused coronavirus dashboard to track the spread of the virus at our school, and launching
                                diversity and equity initiatives, including Spanish-language journalism and community town halls.
