                                            digital editing for this story, charged with taking a long and quite intense story and optimizing its search potential
                                            and reader experience. I worked with the writer to workshop effective subheaders and embed appropriate
                                            visual elements for the narrative to complement the investigation.</li>

                                            editing on this story, which had quite a tight deadline. I compiled the gallery for the lead image, embedded other pictures in a way that helped the story flow and 
                                            making sure the data visualization added to the reader experience.</li>

                                            After years away, ‘Roller Dude’ is back, bringing joy to Chesapeake — and himself</a>. I wrote the headline for this story, changing it 
                                            from a reporter-written headline: "Chesapeake’s ‘Roller Dude’ is back at his busy intersection, after an absence of years." I tweaked this headline
                                            to capture the driving elements of the narrative; namely, that the man's son had died, and he was using his roller skating as 
                                            a coping mechanism. This story was one of our top stories of the week. </li>

                                            of information we needed to convey succinctly, from the details about the man's death to the shutdown of the interstate. I wrote this headline
                                            to include the main elements of the brief while distinguishing the story from our many other traffic stories. </li>

                                            I tweaked from the reporter's suggestion of "Newest bishop with COGIC denomination sees new role as 'an honor' and 'also a burden,'" which was 
                                            a bit clunky and missed the hard news peg that this was one of the youngest bishops ever appointed in the denomination. I also added the 
                                            local connection that the bishop was born and raised in Hampton Roads, which we've seen often increases engagement.</li>

                                        I found that many people — staff, faculty, students, parents, College Park residents alike —

                                        tracking the extent of the virus’s spread in the area. I updated the data every day for 10 months,

                                    about plans for the fall semester, liaising with the university communications department to ensure 
                                    The Diamondback would have total editorial control over the questions we asked. To promote the event 
                                    and solicit community questions, I created a newsletter campaign and Twitter and Instagram graphics. 
                                    Ultimately, 800 students showed up to hear the answers to the questions they cared about.
                                </p>
                                <p> I also collaborated with different student groups on campus, including the Residence Hall Association 
                                    and PLUMAS, a Latinx advocacy group, to set up a process for them to ask questions directly to the 
                                    president. I helped them refine their questions to best reflect the information they wanted to know. 
                                    For the event itself, I coordinated social media and website coverage, with one reporter live tweeting 
                                    and one writing an article for our site.

                                           <p>For this story, I scraped the University of Maryland’s registration site to get data about how many course

                                               I talked to several freshmen about their plans for the fall and how they were making their decisions. </p></li>
