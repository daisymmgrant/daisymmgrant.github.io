                                <h3>ðŸ”˜ <b>Web distribution fellow at Insider</b></h3>

                                I'm currently a social media fellow on Insider's distribution team, where I package and distribute 
                                stories across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. I manage these social channels and ensure that breaking 
                                and timely news gets onto the proper accounts. I write Twitter threads and create social graphics. 
                                I also package stories for Insider's Digg space, our two Telegram channels. 
                                <br><br>
                                I've also been working with Insider's editorial growth team, creating coverage plans for events
                                like the Meta Gala and the Masters based on historical site and social data. I've also conducted 
                                deep dive analyses on our Facebook and Twitter presences to figure out what our audience cares about 
                                on which platforms and how we can better serve them.

                                In the summer of 2021 I was a digital team intern at The Virginian-Pilot and The Daily Press, 
                                where I distributed stories across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. I also helped run the two websites,
                                which involved managing the home pages, writing headlines, and organizing their publication schedules. 
                                <br><br>
                                I also revamped the papers' daily newsletters, using past analytics and market research to redesign the format and strategy.
                                I then wrote original daily copy for both newsletters to add voice, context and depth to the top stories.

                                <h3><b>ðŸ”˜ Editor in chief and engagement editor at The Diamondback</b></h3>
                                I worked at the University of Maryland's student newspaper for 3.5 years while I was at school across 
                                a variety of different roles, including copy editor, managing editor, arts and culture editor, engagement
                                editor, director of digital strategy, and, finally, editor in chief. Some highlights of my time at the DBK include
                                coordinating and executing social media coverage of the 2020 presidential election, creating a 
                                community-focused coronavirus dashboard to track the spread of the virus at our school, and launching
                                diversity and equity initiatives, including Spanish-language journalism and community town halls.
