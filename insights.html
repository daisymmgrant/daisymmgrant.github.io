                                <h2>ðŸ“Š Insights & Analytics Associate Editor at Insider</h2>
                                <h3>Building Tools and Dashboards</h3>
                                <p>Using Google Analytics, Google Looker and Google Sheets, I have built and now maintain many tools and 
                                    dashboards that make performance metrics accessible to editors and reporters throughout the newsroom.
                                    Some tools I've built include: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>a suite of <b>team and author stats dashboards</b>, which allows the entire newsroom to 
                                        access daily story and site performance data, broken down by editorial team and reporter</li>
                                        <li>a <b>monthly source report</b>, an interactive dashboard that updates daily and breaks down our MoM traffic by source and 
                                            displays historical traffic and top stories by source
                                        <li>a <b>stories traffic sources dashboard</b>, an interactive Looker dashboard that 
                                            allows reporters, editors, and audience producers to drill down into source peformance for individual
                                            stories
                                        <li>a <b>special projects series tracker</b>, an interactive tracker that displays the overall performance of high-lift,
                                            sponsored editorial series</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <h3>Ideating and Implementing a Social UTM System</h3>
                                <p>My time working with Insider's social team allowed me to identify a key gap in our newsroom's
                                    ability to gauge performance: We had no way to track what social traffic was a product of the social teamâ€™s work 
                                    and what social traffic was simply organic. I created a plan to introduce UTMs to the social team's workflows, 
                                    communicating with that team's leaders as well as the data engineering team to implement a new system from the ground
                                    up. Now, we have almost a year of reliable data that the social team and I use to assess and guide strategy on different
                                    platforms. </p>
                                <h3>Story Suggestions and Coverage Plans</h3>
                                <p>I use historical traffic and publishing metrics to craft coverage plans for tentpole events, like the Met Gala or
                                    the Masters. For example, in February 2023, I created coverage plans for the Grammys, Valentineâ€™s Day and the Super Bowl. The newsroom 
                                    updated and/or wrote more than 100 of the stories I recommended across the three events, bringing in a total of 14.6 million 
                                    pageviews.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I also work closely with editors and reporters across the newsroom, monitoring search and social trends
                                    in order to flag potential stories that could resonate with our readers. I've trained several people in this process,
                                    and we now have a team of 5+ people suggesting stories to the newsroom. Story ideas we've flagged via this process 
                                    have brought in at least 117M pageviews in the first year!
                                </p>
