                                <h2>ðŸ“± Social Media Fellow at Insider</h2>
                                <h3>Social Creation</h3>
                                <p>I packaged and distributed stories from both Insider and Business Insider 
									across a variety of social and messaging platforms, including Facebook, Twitter (now X, I guess), Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, 
									Digg and Telegram. I worked closely with teams across the newsroom and became adept at breaking down complicated tech, 
									business and news stories, as well
									as tailoring them to the unique interests and needs of the different platforms' audiences.
									<ul>
										<li><b>Twitter</b> - I wrote multiple Twitter threads every day, and dozens of my threads were 
										selected to be featured on the site's sidebar by Twitter's then-editorial curation team, driving
										millions of impressions to our content, as well as thousands of 
										clicks and subscriptions to our site.</li>
										<li><b>Instagram</b> - I created carousel graphics, standalone posts, and Instagram stories.</li>
										<li><b>Digg</b> - I pitched and posted Insider stories to the aggregation site Digg, working as 
										an intermediary between Digg's editorial team and our newsroom. </li>
										<li><b>Telegram</b> - I wrote mini-newsletters to send to our audiences on Telegram, combining
											the biggest headlines of the day with graphics and blurbs into a quick digest for readers.</li>
										<li><b>LinkedIn</b> - I crafted graphics and wrote LinkedIn-style text to promote our biggest business stories
											to our LinkedIn audience, working with LinkedIn's editorial team to craft posts that would get featured in the site's
											sidebar.</li>
										<li><b>Facebook</b> - I helped manage our system that automatically posts our stories to Facebook, using editorial judgment to 
										prioritize the most essential and noteworthy stories for our audiences.</li>
									</ul></p>
									<h3>Social Strategy</h3>
										<p></p>I leveraged off-plaform and site data to gauge impact across platforms and pitch new social strategies
										 across platforms. I routinely wrote analyses with actionable insights for specific platforms, like a plan that  
										 set our strategy for posting analytical features to Twitter. I also wrote guides for reporters and editors on how to 
										 best use specific platforms to promote their own stories, and I used site data to identify emerging platforms with 
										 strong potential for growth, like Reddit.
